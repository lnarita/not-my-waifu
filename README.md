# not-my-waifu

> The Most Trash Not-Yet-Implemented Social Network of the Year

Keep track of your Waifus, receive Animu suggestions based on your Waifu preferences, start Waifu Wars, make THE Best Gril reach the :top: Rankings and MUCH MORE!

## Glossary

In this document, the terms _waifu_ and _best girl_ / _best gril_ is unisex. Please read them as _husbando_, _best boy_ / _best boi_ if you want.

## Objectives

Destroy friendships over the question: “Who’s the best gril/boi?” (The answer is obviously Astolfo for both. I do not take criticism)

## What is not-my-waifu about?

Providing a place to assert Waifu superiority, safely start Waifu Wars and showcasing your waifu preferences.

## What is not-my-waifu not about?

This is not about Ship Wars. This is not about bad mouthing other people's waifus.

## Ideas and Motivations

We live in a society and struggle as one.

I just want to have a cool anime-related project like crypko.ai so I can change my title to Weeb Dev.

### Waifu Wars

Every X days, a new Ultimate Best Gril election takes place.

Users can vote for their waifus.

TODO: think of great things Ultimate Best Gril followers can do when their waifu is elected.

### Devs are Gods Day

Every April 1st will be entitled “Devs are Gods” day.

I save my rights to intervene within Waifu Wars and proclaim my own Waifu as the Ultimate Best Gril for a single day.

I won’t take criticism for this.

### Brainstorms and possible next steps

- Can we use not-my-waifu to test better ballot methods?
- Can it be decentralized while keeping it moderated?
    - Can we take a hybrid approach? Centralized login and Orchestration node (to gather statistics and route users), but each hub operates in a standalone manner.
- Local x Global Waifu Wars
    - Sometimes you just need to assert superiority to your close group of friends
- How to fill Anime / Character data?
- Can we add hyped technologies in this project? Like AI and blockchain

## Q&A

- Is this a joke project?

Maybe.

- Will you ever start this project?

Someday, but not today.
